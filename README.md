K-Means clustering was applied on the standardized numerical features of the churn dataset to identify underlying customer segments. The elbow method and silhouette scores were used to estimate the optimal number of clusters, which was found to be three. The dataset was reduced to two principal components using PCA for visualization, allowing the clusters to be viewed in a 2D space. The resulting clusters revealed distinct groupings of customers based on their usage patterns and service interactions, offering insights that could support targeted marketing strategies and churn reduction initiatives.
